Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, no they won't
Boy, don't even try to touch this (touch this)
Boy, this beat is crazy (crazy)
This is how they made me (made me)
Houston, Texas, baby
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later
I think I need a barber (barber)
None of these niggas can fade me (fade me)
I'm so good with this, I remind you, I'm so hood with this
Boy, I'm just playing
Come here, baby
Hope you still like me, F you, pay me
